  <h1>Jordan Taylor</h1>
  <p>I enjoy spending time with my wife, Nasa, more than anything else. I also enjoy working with computers, whether it be gaming, watching movies or TV Shows and I quite enjoy programming.</p>
  <h2>Programming History</h2>
  <p>I first learned computer programming at BYU in my Freshman year in 2008. I was taught Java, by Professor Burton. This past fall I had to retake the class because the language was changed to C++. I have quite a bit of web coding experience, mostly using Ruby on Rails.</p>
